You have to follow these rules:
## Do:

1. Strictly follow [pocketflow-python.md](mdc:pocketflow-python.md) requirements
2. Use functional programming techniques exclusively
3. Maintain immutability throughout
4. Implement e2e tests for all features with real CLI and file operations
5. Ensure all changes pass `bun test`
6. Write isolated test cases using bun:test without mocks
7. Create challenging, thorough test cases that fully verify implementation
8. Test cases should match expected [pocketflow-python.md](mdc:pocketflow-python.md) requirements
9. Use DRY principle across all files

## Don't:
10. Avoid OOP, classes, or inheritance
11. Avoid traditional methods (use higher order functions instead)
12. Don't write comments
13. Don't use `any` or `unknown` types
14. Do not create code of simulation, stub, mock, etc. you should produce code of real expected features
15. Should not create another files other than these:
   - `src/constants.ts` configuration defaults
   - `src/core.ts` - Core functionality
   - `src/types.ts` - Type definitions
   - `src/utils.ts` - Utility functions
   - `src/test/e2e/* & src/test/unit/*` - Test files
